Karan Johar at India Today Conclave Mumbai 2019

You cannot have Karan Johar on the hot seat and not throw rapid-fire questions at him. So when the Lust Stories director took the interviewee's seat on Day 1 of the India Today Conclave Mumbai 2019, during a session titled Cinema Czar: The Final Word - The Dream Maker: Karan Johar on ruling Bollywood, there was a fun rapid-fire round waiting just for him.

Karan Johar was asked several questions, some tough, some rather simple, others were thought-provoking. And the director-producer-actor responded to each one of them with characteristic humour. But the one response that caught our eye was when KJo was asked about our Prime minister Narendra Modi.

He was asked what he'd do if he woke up as Narendra Modi. To which he said, "I would keep doing what I'm doing." And in that one line, KJo summed up all his admiration for the Prime Minister.

Other fun questions that were thrown at KJo were: Shah Rukh Khan or Kajol, who is a better actor? To that, he unapologetically said, Shah Rukh Khan. If you could transform into someone, who would that be, and Karan named Meryl Streep. What tag-line would he give himself if he were an ad-guru, and he said, "'He came.' He did not see or conquer, he came." Of course, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to spot the pun there.

On the work front, Karan Johar is currently prepping for the ambitious project Takht that boasts of an ensemble cast with Ranveer Singh, Vicky Kaushal, Alia Bhatt, Kareena Kapoor Khan, among others. Apart from this, he has several movies hitting the screens, from Ayushmann Khurrana's Bala to Vicky Kaushal's Bhoot Part One: The Haunted Ship.
